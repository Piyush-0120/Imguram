# Imguram
Imguram is an android application which allows you to see top posts and stories from Imgur.

## Getting Started
- Import the project or download it to your computer.
## Imgur API key
Imguram uses the [Imgur API][1] to load pictures and gifs on the screen. To use the API, you will need 
to obtain a free developer API key. See the [Imgur API Documentation][2] for instructions.

Once you have the key, add this key to `ImgurClient.kt` file (usually
`libimgur/src/main/java/com/example/libimgur/ImgurClient.kt` in project's root folder.
